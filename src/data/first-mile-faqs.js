        question: "How different is this from an accelerator programme?",
        answer: [
            "Very. Instead of broad support for a large(ish) number of businesses with a focus on raising capital and scaling, we've designed our programme to prioritise personal support over a longer period of time",
            "We want to help all participants to deeply introspect deeply as to what kind of company they want to build, and then help them achieve that. If scale is what you want, we'll help you do that in a way that works for you. Equally if staying small is a goal for you, we're here to support. Thik of us almost as a decelerator.",
            "We also don't take any equity in companies on the programme."

        question: "How much time will I get with mentors?",
        answer: [
            "Every participant will have up to 3 'core mentors', who will be matched to you based on what you want to achieve during the programme. These mentors will spend a minimum of one hour a month with you over the course of the year.",
            "As well as this, there will be over 40 'on-call' mentors who have agreed to meet with participants for up to 2 hours at a time to help you with specific problems. The Adventure team will act as the conduit and matchmaker for these mentors, but there will also be a live directory of these mentors, which you will have access to and that will include direct contact details."

        answer: [
            "The pledge must be payed back within 5 years (so long as your company is still operating), but we will leave the exact time within those 5 years up to you unless certain milestones are hit.",
            "These milestones are a sale of your company, raising over £500,000 in investment, or earning over £500,000 in revenue within a year. If any of these are hit, the pledge asks you to pay back the £20,000 in that year."

        question: "What do you mean by creative company?",
        answer: [
            "Creativity for us is in part a description of the output you have: if you're design-led, care about brand, or xxxxx, then you're a creative company. Creativity to us is also about the way you operate your business and your way of tackling problems."

        question: "Do I have to be based in London",
        answer: [
            "No. We actively look to make this opportunity to be accessible to all first-time founders across the UK. All mentorship is available remotely, and our stipend is in part to cover travel costs to enable you to spend time with us."

    {
        question: "What is the stipend for?",
        answer: [
            "Covering the travel costs associated with being on the programme, helping you invest in products, services and people, enabling you to spend more time focusing on the company. The stipend is for anything that you feel could meaningfully impact the way you run your business over the course of the year."

This includes ustwobies from our studio and games teams, founders and employees from other startups we have invested in, and individuals from our Adventure community. We welcome new mentors so if you know anyone who might be interested then ask them to reach out to us at hello.adv@ustwo.com."

        question: "Why do I have to pay back the funds?",
        answer: [
            "We want to build a sustainable programme of support for founders like you. This means paying your pledge forwards will enable more people to have the same experience.",
            "We've chosen £20,000 as the payback to cover the stipend (£10,000), and the year of support from ustwo (which for the programme we also value at £10,000)."

        question: "Will you help me find investors?",
        answer: [
            "If that's what you want help with during the programme, then yes. We welcome all styles of business regardless of the path they want to take, and will be helping you think about scaling and all the ways you could do it with a real focus on sustainability."
