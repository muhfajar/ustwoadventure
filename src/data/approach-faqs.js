        question: "Do you lead rounds?",
        answer: [
            "No, we do not. And that is simply because most of the time a fundraising around is much bigger than the size of the investment we can make. We will instead rely on an institutional investor to negotiate a term sheet and decide to invest (or not) based on those terms."

    {
        question: "How big is your fund?",
        answer: [
            "Technically, we don't operate a fund. The investments we make are funded, as they say, from balance sheet. We go through a budgeting process every year to determine how much capital we can invest, and that amount has historically ranged from £250-500k. As such, given our investment size, we are looking at making up to 10 investments a year, but a few of those may be following on in existing portfolio companies."

        question: "What's your ideal stage for investment?",
        answer: [
            "Always a tricky question because there is no perfect answer. We would typically expect companies to at least reached these milestones:",
            "— Product: You have built and launched your product, even if it is a Minimum Viable Product.",
            "— Revenue: You have paying customers (ideally paying full price). A good indication of traction would be at least £5,000 of monthly recurring revenue.",
            "— Team: You and your co-founders (if you have any) have committed to full-time working in the business. You may have even made your first hire(s).",
            "Like every investor, we will occasionally invest into companies that don't fit these guidelines. We will also invest in later stage companies, but we know that at some point our size check simply doesn't do enough to move the needle in raising a larger round. "

        question: "How are your investments usually structured?",
        answer: [
            "To date, we've predominantly invested in the usual venture formats: equity, convertible loan notes, SAFEs or ASAs.",
            "More recently, we have also participated in structures championed by the likes of Earnest Capital and Indie VC, who have crafted instruments that incentivise profitable, sustainable businesses with equity conversion mechanisms that allow for venture funding in the future. We are excited to continue to develop experience with these structures."

            "For the most part, we invest in the United Kingdom. However, we are open to investing in other places, particularly if we also have an ustwo presence (US, Australia, Sweden). As a relatively small investor, the main thing for us is understanding the legal jurisdiction."

            "Does ustwo provide design services and support as part of the investment?",
        answer: [
            "The short answer is no. The best way to think about our support is as advisors rather than delivery partners. We will do all we can to help you access expertise across our network of employees for targeted advice and perspective. But we are unable to stand up product teams to support our investments."

        question: "What's your investment process?",
        answer: [
            "The generic process looks something like this:",
            "1. Company applies for funding",
            "2. We review the materials",
            "3. If there is a clear initial fit, we'll have a call or meeting to understand the company, the founders, and the current funding situation",
            "4. If we confirm there is a strong fit with our criteria and we can make a meaningful contribution to the funding round, we will begin due diligence.",
            "5. If the due diligence is promising, we will create an internal investment memo that is shared with the ustwo board for comments and feedback.",
            "6. If the board is supportive, then we will ask if we can invest!",
            "It's hard to predict how long this takes. Every company and every round is different. We can do steps 2 and 3 quickly. Steps 4 and 5 can take a bit longer, especially if the round hasn't quite come together. Step 6 usually takes about a week."

    {
        question: "Do you take a board seat?",
        answer: [
            "Generally, no. Partly because we rarely have a position large enough to warrant one. But more philosophically, we are not in the investment game to exert control over entrepreneurs. We prefer to build a rapport of trust and support that is outside formal designations."

        question: "Do you do follow on investments?",
        answer: [
            "We have very limited budget for following on, so we tell companies that it is not something that they should necessarily expect from us. We by no means want that to be a negative signal for their future investors and we will always be happy to talk to prospective investors about that.",
            "That said, we have followed on as and when our budget allows and where there is a really strong fit with business performance and our area of expertise."
