                    <p>
                        For any creative business the first steps are often the
                        hardest. We know because we’ve done it, and now we want
                        to help the next generation of founders do the same.

                    <p>
                        We’ll give you 12 months of mentorship and personal
                        support from ustwobies and our Adventure community —
                        with anything from tech troubleshooting to building a
                        long-term strategy. As well as this you&apos;ll get a

                        We want to help kick start a new wave of creative
                        leaders — people who understand the value of design,
                        culture and long-term thinking, and who want to create
                        lasting impact.

                        you with the belief, network and tools to build
                        purposeful businesses, from the inside out.

                        participants on their way.

                    <h3>Paying it forwards</h3>
                    <p>
                        When you come on board, we ask you to sign a pledge to
                        pay it forwards. This means if your business is still
                        going in five years, you give back £12,500 to the
                        programme.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We’ve worked this out as £10,000 for the stipend, and
                        £2,500 to help the programme be sustainable for future
                        cohorts. To be clear, this money doesn’t come to us. All
                        of it goes straight back into the First Mile programme
                        to continue helping new businesses get off the ground.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Criteria</h3>
                    <p>
                        the hard criteria for being eligible for First Mile is
                        that it must be your first time starting a business and
                        you must be based in the UK. You&apos;ll also need to
                        have a company entity up and running before you start.
                        Beyond this, we&apos;ll be looking for participants that
                        are authentic, comitted, and for who the programme will
                        be a real help.
